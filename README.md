## Angular Alpha 101_02 Basic Demonstration
#### January 2018  AngularJS/Express.js/Node.js Demonstration

 
A small basic application to introduce some Angular concepts.
This is a minimal index.htm and app.js
.\partials\home.html contains the view.


This is not a proper SPA, it has no styling, it has no peristence.


It demonstrates ng-* directives to present the dynamic data

ng-click     	- used to call the function on the button
ng-model	 	- used to bind to the $scope model
ng-repeat		- used to iterate an array
